munin-node requires that you configure it manually via /etc/munin/munin-node.conf to not
launch in the background.  However, the current version in Debian 7 continues to fork()
itself and escape supervision, even with the backgrounding option set to zero.

As such, it is not compatible with supervision, until the background switch can be 
obeyed as intended.
