Suggestions and improvements were taken from the supervision mailing list 
(supervision@list.skarnet.org), specifically from (in no set order):

Laurent Bercot
Alex Efros

Their contributions are greatly appreciated.

Service control scripts were donated graciously by James Powell <james4591 -AT- hotmail.com> of 
the runit-for-lfs project, to be either used directly, modified, or studied for their 
operation.  I'd like to give many thanks for the dontation from that project's team.

Scripts for ypbind and autofs were improved by Luke Diamand (luke -AT- diamand.org).  Thank you for your help.

Additional suggestions provided in an email from drwilly@drwille.de, and were implemented in sv/.run/run.sh
