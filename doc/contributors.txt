Suggestions and improvements were taken from the supervision mailing list 
(supervision@list.skarnet.org), specifically from (in no set order):

Laurent Bercot
Alex Efros

Their contributions are greatly appreciated.

Service control scripts were donated graciously by James Powell <james4591 -AT- hotmail.com> of 
the runit-for-lfs project, to be either used directly, modified, or studied for their 
operation.  I'd like to give many thanks for the dontation from that project's team.
