# Introduction #

The supervision-scripts project is an attempt to combine all of the 
needed pieces to allow a single set of service definitions be used under 
daemontools/runit/s6.  These templates follow a general format that allows them to be used in those frameworks.  The target environment is Debian stable.

# Features #

* When possible, and time permitting, retroactive support for SysV init scripts will be provided.  Runit does provide a hook for this by creating a symlink of /etc/init.d/(service) back to the runit binary.  TODO: find out what daemontools and s6 provide, and if they will support this feature.

* When possible, logging will conform to the framework that the script is being used in.  Each framework has a slightly different take on logging but they also come with their own tools and processes.  Using the correct logger for the correct environment then becomes important.

When possible, and time permitting, additional framework-specific support will be added.  These items typically do not impact the other frameworks, so they can co-exist side by side.

* When possible, common activities will use templates instead of actual code, reducing development time, increasing code accuracy, and reducing potential bugs by reducing code surface.
