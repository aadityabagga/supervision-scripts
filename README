# Introduction #

The supervision-scripts project is an attempt to combine all of the needed pieces to allow a single set of process management definitions be used under daemontools/runit/s6.  These templates follow a general format that allows them to be used in those frameworks.  The target environment is Debian stable.

# Features #

* When possible, logging will conform to the framework that the script is being used in.  Each framework has a slightly different take on logging but they also come with their own tools and processes.  Using the correct logger for the correct environment then becomes important.

* When possible, additional framework-specific support will be added.  These items typically do not impact the other frameworks, so they can co-exist side by side.

* When possible, common activities will use templates instead of actual code, reducing development time, increasing code accuracy, and reducing potential bugs by reducing code surface.
